Test Page set up - THOMAS
    Be able to swipe through flash cards, no word list

Have the wordbox be clickable - PERRY
    make it so that the button will have different funcitonality depending on page
        Edit page - click and able to edit that card
        Library page - click and just see the card

Change wordbox to pull from database in these situations:
    3: Word is edited (CAN'T BE DONE YET)
    4: Word tag is edited (CAN'T BE DONE YET)

Make flash card pretty (AKA flip functionality)
    Probably make it a component that can be exported throughout
